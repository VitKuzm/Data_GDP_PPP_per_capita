#Hi, I'm Vitali!

The repository includes the info about the projects I worked with:



##1. GDP PPP per capita and its correlation with level of corruption and and Life Expectancy.

Project description:

Ordinary GDP per capita shows the level of production without taking into account prices in the country. 
Whereas PPP helps us to estimate the gross domestic product produced in the country adjusted to its price levels. 
GDP PPP per capita  is the main indicator of economic development or how rich or poor a country is. 
The report of GDP PPP per capita is annually published by the World bank.
