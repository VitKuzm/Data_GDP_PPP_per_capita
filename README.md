<h3>1. GDP PPP per capita and its correlation with level of corruption and and Life Expectancy.</h3>

Project description:

Whereas PPP helps us to estimate the gross domestic product produced in the country adjusted to its price levels. 
GDP PPP per capita  is the main indicator of economic development or how rich or poor a country is.
